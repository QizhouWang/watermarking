# Watermarking for Out-of-distribution Detection

This repository is the official implementation of the NeurIPS'22 paper [Watermarking for Out-of-distribution Detection](), authored by Qizhou Wang *, Feng Liu *, Yonggang Zhang, Jing Zhang, Chen Gong, Tongliang Liu, and Bo Han. Our method utilizes the reprogramming properties of deep models, boosting the capablity of models in OOD detection without changing their parameters.
